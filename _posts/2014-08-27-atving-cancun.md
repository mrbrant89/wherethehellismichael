There are two 5 km ATV tracks and you can do each track once. The first track took us about 30 minutes to complete and we had a lot of fun going through the tunnels, bridges, caves and water features. We all got wet and muddy and it was great. The ATV in front of us didnâ€™t have working headlights, so that created a couple of collisions and delays in the tunnels which kept things interesting.
