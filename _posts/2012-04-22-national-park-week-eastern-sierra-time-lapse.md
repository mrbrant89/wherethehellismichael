To celebrate earth day and National Park Week I am going to feature the top 10 viral National Park videos over the next week.

<a href="http://vimeo.com/24298269">Eastern Sierra Time Lapse</a> by <a href="http://vimeo.com/vistapointstudio">Jeff Chen Kuo Chih</a>
<blockquote>A second 6-day trip through the California Eastern Sierra, from 350 feet below sea-level at the Badwaters in Death Valley National Park to 12,000 feet above, in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest. Very exhausting trip with only few hours sleep a day. The weather kept changing very suddenly, from sunny to stormy and back. Gusts of wind blew up several of my night time scenes. I hope you enjoy my video.</blockquote>
Here are images of my own travels through <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm">Yosemite</a> and the Eastern Sierras:
