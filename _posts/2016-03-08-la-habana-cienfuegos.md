Today we drove from Havana to Cienfuegos. In total the drive is about 5 hours in a rather cramped can, but we had a couple of stops to break it up.

<strong>Several Observations</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The roads are quite nice for the most part. Not a lot of potholes. Not a lot of traffic.</li>
	<li>We have a kid in our taxi who works with the driver as a helper. He stood up in the sliding-door step most of the trip. It seemed like his only job was to assist with luggage and stuff. This honestly seemed a little silly considering both the driver and guide could do this. But he's a sweet kid so no complaints.</li>
	<li>Rest stops or toilets are few and far between. It would appear that the few Cubans who own cars don't drive long distances in them.</li>
	<li>We stopped at a little spot in the road along a gorgeous beach. There was a big bag made out of lava rock. Right on site there was diving, snorkeling and a small bar. Also a guy who would rent you chairs for $5 each. I had a beer and a mojito and just relaxed on the beach.</li>
</ul>
