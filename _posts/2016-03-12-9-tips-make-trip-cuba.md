	<li>Bring snacks. You can only buy food here at government run stores who have inconsistent hours and not much to choose from.</li>
	<li>Most public toilets are pretty bad. Always carry toilet paper and hand sanitizer.</li>
	<li>There is a $25 CUC exit tax. Make sure to save some money for that.</li>
	<li>$25 CUC taxi fare from Havana to the airport. It takes 30 mins to get there and you need to be there three hours early. It is <strong>very important</strong> that you pay attention once you're at your gate. Gates can change <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without notice</span> and the information monitors will not necessarily reflect the change - so listen for announcements.</li>
	<li>I cannot emphasize enough that things move slowly, so a little patience goes a long ways. There are frequent power cuts coupled with government employees who make their same $20 per month if they work quickly or not. So they just don't care. And if you get frustrated they look at you like you're the one with the problem.</li>
	<li>Toilet paper is single ply and leaves a lot to be desired. Especially in public toilets, the attendant doesn't give you much. Carry packs of tissues or better yet - “dude wipes” or the girly equivalent for the women folk.</li>
	<li>Bring a Spanish phrase book with you such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1743214472/ref=as_li_ss_tl?pf_rd_p=1944687522&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=1742208096&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1DJ21J38ZCHTN56RWAR9&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mm0da-20&amp;linkId=00f497d10e790a70161903b2fdf5890c">Lonely Planet</a> one. Google Translate requires Internet to work so that rules out most of Cuba.</li>
	<li>Despite what you may see - people dress to impress - Cuba is a very poor country. The average government employee makes less than $50 CUC per month. When you are at a Casa Particular what they are giving you is their absolute best. Probably better than what the family themselves live with - especially in the case of air conditioning. Whenever someone asks you toda bien? (“is everything okay?”) enthusiastically say si even if it is far below your usual standards.</li>
	<li>They do have Internet. And it is surprisingly fast. But you can only get it at public wifi squares from the government telecom company. Cards cost $2 CUC per 1 hour and requires your passport to buy them. Lines are sometimes long and they are never in a hurry so buy enough cards to last your entire trip so you only have to wait in line once.</li>
</ol>
If you are interested in taking the same trip that we did, we went on the <a href="http://locallysourcedcuba.com/our-tours/discover/8-day-cuba-group-tour/">8 Day Cuba Group Tour - Lively Cuba</a> tour with the company <a href="http://locallysourcedcuba.com/">Locally Sourced Cuba</a>. I can't emphasize enough how much I loved our guide Yunier and enjoyed seeing a different side to Cuba.
