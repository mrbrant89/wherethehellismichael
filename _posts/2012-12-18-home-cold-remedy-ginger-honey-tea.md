Being sick really sucks. I've had a cold for a few days now and it's really getting in the way of my productivity with work. Unfortunately since a cold is a virus, there isn't much you can do about it except for wait it out.

I've found some simple steps you can take it to make it less miserable and a few home remedies that help a lot.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Vicks Vaporub</strong> - apply to your chest, throat and nose. It helps break up the congestion.</li>
	<li><strong>Neti Pot</strong> - irrigate your nose in the shower, it helps to get out all of the sickness.</li>
	<li><strong>Ginger Tea</strong> - helps to boost your immune system and break up chest congestion.</li>
</ol>
I'm not a huge fan of ginger, but this tea really does help.
<ol>
	<li>Fill up your teakettle and get it boiling.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, grate a one-inch piece of fresh ginger root.</li>
	<li>Get out a teapot or thermos.</li>
	<li>Put the ginger in the teapot.</li>
	<li>Put four tablespoons of lemon juice.</li>
	<li>Add four tablespoons of honey (to taste).</li>
	<li>When your water is boiled, pour it into the teapot.</li>
	<li>Cover it up and let it steep for 20 minutes.</li>
	<li>Strain into a tea cup and enjoy!</li>
</ol>

When it comes to being sick, I always prefer to try natural remedies to taking drugs that will damage my liver and cause side effects.
