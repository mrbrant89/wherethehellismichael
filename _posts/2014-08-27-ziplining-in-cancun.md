We headed to the ziplining area to get geared up. There are two different ziplining courses with 7 ziplines each and then one water landing attached to each course. Itâ€™s slightly weird having to swim while being attached to a zipline. I was amazed that my Mom, at 59 years old was not only brave enough to go ziplining, but smiling from ear to ear in the pictures. She thoroughly enjoyed it.

The ziplines start out at the main tower and ends at the base of another tower. Each tower gets taller and taller and eventually ends at a waterfall aquatic landing.
