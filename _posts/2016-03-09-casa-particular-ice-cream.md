Understandably we have a bit of a language barrier in Cuba. On the second night in Cienfuegos our host family asked us if we want coffee. I said yes and then my Mom asked for ice.

I asked the host if she had <i>hielo</i> (ice) and she asked if I meant <i>helado</i> (ice cream) and I said no, I mean <i>hielo</i>. Anyway in the end she just assumed I don't know what I'm asking and brought ice cream.

It's delicious. Mint ice cream. But my Mom and I are both lactose intolerant. So we can't actually eat it. And I know things like ice cream are a huge luxury here. So I feel really bad.

They are the sweetest family here at this <i>casa particular</i>. I'm very impressed with their hospitality. They provide air conditioning for their guests even though they themselves don't use it. The rooms are cute and comfortable. They have a rooftop deck to look over the ocean and see the stars.
