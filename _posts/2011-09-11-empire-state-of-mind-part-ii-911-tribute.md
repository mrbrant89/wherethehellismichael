<p align="justify">To commemorate the 10th anniversary of 9/11, State Farm partnered with award-winning director Spike Lee to film a touching tribute to thank the heroes of New York. Nearly 150 school children (ages 8-11) from the New York City area visited four firehouses and thanked the firefighters through song.</p>
