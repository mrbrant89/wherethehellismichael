My Mom started me cooking at a young age. And I love cooking. But most of my experience has been cooking stir fry, stews, soups, pasta dishes, etc. Things which do not have much meat or if they do have meat, it's thin enough that you can just fry it.

Lately I've been taking an interest in cooking pieces of meat. And this was my first successful attempt at steak.

I got tips from my Mom as well as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmC9SmCBUj4">Gordon Ramsey Youtube video</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46eRIxVxkG8">Jamie Oliver Youtube video</a>. So now I can thank Gordon Ramsey for learning how to properly cut an onion and how to cook a steak!
