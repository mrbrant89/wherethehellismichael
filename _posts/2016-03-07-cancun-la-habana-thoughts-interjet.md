We flew from Cancun to La Habana Cuba which took approximately 1 hour. We flew the airline Interjet which I had always heard was a crappy airline but it was actually great.

<strong>Thoughts About Interjet</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Upon arrival to the Cancun airport, they had a separate line for each destination.</li>
	<li>The Cuba line had a lady sitting at a folding table with a laptop who issued Visas for $20 USD on the spot. Super convenient.</li>
	<li>At the counter they check your passport and visa, collect your Mexican visa and then check you in.</li>
	<li>Each person gets one piece of checked baggage each.</li>
	<li>Like Ryanair, they don't invest in jet bridges. They load everyone onto a shuttle bus and drive them out to a plane on the Tarmac.</li>
	<li>The plane itself was an Airbus 319 with a 2-3 configuration.</li>
	<li>There was ample legroom and I appreciated that I only had to sit next to my Mom with no one in the middle seat.</li>
	<li>They serve free snacks and free alcohol on all flights. The alcohol pour was super generous. I got about 3oz of Jack Daniels and a full bottle of Pepsi.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Thoughts About Cancun Airport</strong>
<ul>
	<li>No working wifi. I paid twice: once by PayPal, once by Credit Card. Didn't connect.</li>
	<li>It's weird that they don't assign a gate to flights until right before it boards. You have to hang out in a common area.</li>
	<li>Food and drinks are expensive. I bought a 300ml can of Tecate and two 500ml bottles of water for M$180 (US$10).</li>
</ul>
