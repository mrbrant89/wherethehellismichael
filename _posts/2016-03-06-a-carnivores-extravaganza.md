<p>On a whim this past Friday, my Mom and I drove down to Cheripan in Tijuana, Baja California because we wanted to eat some really good meat.</p><p>Without realizing it, I had been to another location of this restaurant last year. I didn't realize they had three different locations. This location is in "Distrito Gastronomico" (Gastronomic District) near the fancy hotels.</p><p>Because the prices here are a steal compared to what you would pay in the US, we decided to order the spread:</p><ul><li><strong>Drinks</strong> Sangria, Lemonade</li><li><strong>Empanadas</strong> Chorizo &amp; Potato, Peppers &amp; Onions, Ground Beef (Picadillo)</li><li><strong>Main</strong>&nbsp;Sampler Platter including chorizo, beef cheek, pork chop, flank steak, strip steak, chicken breast, grilled peppers, chile and onions.</li></ul><p>With the exception of the beef cheek (literally called "beef sweetbreads" in Spanish) which tastes like a big blob of fat, I thoroughly enjoyed everything, especially the chorizo which is very unlike Mexican chorizo.</p><p>Although everything is quite good, their true magic lies in their beef. The next time I eat here I will be ordering the ribeye.</p>
